This app was a personal project to provide an alternative interface for myself and other students of the Duale Hochschule Sachsen to access their data.
I was quite dissatisfied with the official web app being the only way to access grades, schedules and other important information. There were some other,
inofficial apps, but they were either not maintained or lacked important features. And I wanted to have a configurable timetable, where I could color or hide
certain courses. Additionally, I wanted to have a quick overview of my grades, upcoming exams and average calculation. But most importantly, I wanted to have
offline access as well as credential caching, so I could access my data without needing to log in every time. All of this led to the development of this app.

> To be honest, I didn't put as much effort into this app as I could have. It was originally intended as a personal project, however my friends requested to
use it as well, so I decided to publish it to the Play Store. I never intended to maintain it long-term, particuarly since I won't be a student at the Duale 
Hochschule Sachsen for much longer. However I still want to keep it available for those who find it useful and I am happy to pass it on to someone else who
wants to maintain it in the future.

## Technologies Used
- Flutter (the main framework for building the app)
- Dart (used by Flutter)  
- Android tools (for building and signing APKs)  
- Kotlin (for writing the Widget)

## Noteworthy Features
- Scrapes and parses data from the Campus Dual website, sometimes impersonating the user to fetch information  
- APK releases for easy installation as well as automatic publishing to the Google Play Store
- Offline-first approach with credential caching
- Timetable as a widget

## Personal Insights

## Other Ideas
- **Maintainer Call:** The project is seeking a new maintainer as my access to campus dual may be limited in the future.  
- **Edge Case Warning:** The app relies heavily on scraping, which can be brittle and may not cover all scenarios. Users should be aware of potential issues.  
- **Logging:** Due to the scraping nature, it would be beneficial to implement logging to help diagnose issues. 
- **Platform Expansion:** Consider future support for other platforms, such as iOS or web.  
- **Refactoring:** The current codebase works, but it could benefit from refactoring to improve maintainability and readability. For example, migrating to Riverpod for state management and using more idiomatic Dart/Flutter practices.
